## Purpose
- The Bookstore App is meant to ease the pain that book store owners have had to face with operating computer systems from 90s. Keeping this in mind we designed an app which can be used on a portable device like mobile with a simple and easy to use interface.

## How to run it?
- We have created this app on Android Studio Version 4.1.1 and Gradle version 6.5.
- Its really simple to run our app
    - Just [clone](https://github.com/HarshalBhalerao/BookStore-App.git) it from our repository 
    - Build it and run it.
    
**Important Note:**
- Some of the system tests can be flaky due to Android window transitions. To fix this, disable window transition in the system settings. On the Nexus 7, this you can enable "Remove animations" in the accessibility settings. On other devices, you may need to enable developer options and disable "Window animation scale" and "Transition animation scale".
