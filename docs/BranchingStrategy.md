# Branching Strategy
- There are 3 main branches to this project: 
    - Logic branch: This is where logic layer would be implemented
    - Database branch: This is where Database layer would be implemented
    - GUI branch: This is where GUI layer would be implemented

- At most 2 people work on each branch.
- All the development of code takes places in these 3 branches. 
- We merge this code into our develop branch to test our code.
- Once the code is completed, tested and when everything works as intended, we then push that code to our master branch.
